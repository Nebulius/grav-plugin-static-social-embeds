        If true, images from tweets/toots/instagram posts/etc. will be downloaded and served from your site instead of
        the social network (including avatars). With that, the independence is complete but it requires more disk space.

            To use Twitter embeds, you'll need to register an application.<br />
            Go to <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new">the Twitter Apps page</a> to create an application.
            You don't need to provide a callback URL (we never use that).
            Then, click the <strong>Keys and access tokens</strong> tab and at the bottom of the page, click
            <strong>Create my Access Token</strong>.
            Finally, copy the credentials here.
