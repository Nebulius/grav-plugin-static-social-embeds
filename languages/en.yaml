    DOWNLOADS:
      TITLE: Download Options
      HELP_1: |
        If theses options are enabled, images and/or videos from tweets/toots/instagram posts/etc. will be downloaded
        and served from your site instead of the social network (including avatars). With that, the independence is
        complete but it requires more disk space (about 3 MiB per image, 15 to 50 MiB per video, and almost nothing for
        avatars).<br /><br />

        <em>If this is disabled, Firefox users will not see images by default, as Firefox blocks images and videos loaded
        from other domains for privacy reasons. They will have to disable the privacy protection by clicking the shield
        in their address bar.</em>
      HELP_2: |
        Embeds data is (always) stored in <code>cache/static-social-embeds/</code>.<br />
        You can delete this folder at any time: the content will be re-downloaded on-demand.<br /><br />

        Images and videos are downloaded (if enabled) to <code>images/static-social-embeds/</code>.<br />
        <strong>Never delete this folder without deleting the embeds data cache directory too.</strong>
        If medias are downloaded, stored embed data references directly the local files, so deleting them without
        deleting the cache will break all images.

          If true, images from tweets/toots/instagram posts/etc. will be downloaded and served from your site instead of

    TWITTER:
      TITLE: Twitter
      HELP: |
        Embed tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> in articles using <code>[tweet="tweetURL"]</code>
        with blanks lines before and after.<br /><br />
        <strong>Warning:</strong> as tweets are retrieved using your account permissions, <strong>you can embed
        tweets from private accounts</strong> as long as you follow them; because the tweets are requested once and
        stored locally, they will be kept even if you lose access to the private account. <strong>Don't abuse this
        feature</strong> and before embedding a private tweet, be sure that the author allows you to do so.
      HELP_APP: |
         <strong>To use Twitter embeds, you'll need to register an application.</strong><br /><br />
         Go to <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new">the Twitter Apps page</a> to create an application.
         You don't need to provide a callback URL (we never use that).
         Then, click the <strong>Keys and access tokens</strong> tab and at the bottom of the page, click
         <strong>Create my Access Token</strong>.
         Finally, copy the credentials here.

        unlisted and public ones are fine).
